# Framebuffer Initialization Issue

## Problem
Framebuffer initialization is currently failing because Limine bootloader is not properly providing Multiboot2 information.

## Symptoms
```
MB2: parse_multiboot2_info() called with addr 0x0000000000032100
MB2: total_size = 0x0000000000000000
MB2: ERROR - total_size too small
EFI System Table: 0x0000000000000000
WARNING: Framebuffer initialization failed - no graphics available
```

## Root Cause
- Limine is configured with `PROTOCOL=multiboot2` in `limine.cfg`
- However, the Multiboot2 structure at address 0x32100 has `total_size = 0`
- No Multiboot2 tags (including framebuffer tag) are being provided
- EFI System Table pointer is also 0

## Investigation Done
1. ✅ Added framebuffer request tag to Multiboot2 header
2. ✅ Added RESOLUTION config to limine.cfg
3. ✅ Added debug logging to MB2 parsing
4. ❌ Multiboot2 structure is still empty

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Switch to Limine Native Protocol (Recommended)
Limine has its own boot protocol that's more reliable than its Multiboot2 compatibility layer.

**Required Changes:**
- Rewrite `boot/multiboot2_header.s` to use Limine protocol
- Update boot entry code to receive Limine boot info structure
- Parse Limine framebuffer tags instead of Multiboot2 tags
- Update `mm/multiboot2.c` or create new `boot/limine_protocol.c`

**Advantages:**
- Limine's native protocol is well-supported and documented
- Will reliably provide framebuffer information
- Better UEFI integration

**Disadvantages:**
- Significant code rewrite (estimated 200-300 lines)
- Changes to boot flow

### Option 2: Use Direct EFI GOP Access
Access the EFI Graphics Output Protocol directly without bootloader assistance.

**Required Changes:**
- Implement EFI GOP driver
- Scan EFI system table for GOP
- Manually configure framebuffer from GOP info

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex EFI protocol handling
- Requires EFI system table to be available (currently also 0)

### Option 3: Defer Framebuffer Until Later
- Keep kernel bootable and stable
- Focus on other subsystems (scheduler, memory management)
- Tackle framebuffer in a dedicated session

## Current Status
- Kernel boots successfully WITHOUT framebuffer
- All other subsystems work (IDT, PIC, memory management)
- Serial output is available for debugging
- System reaches "MVP SUCCESS!" state

## Recommendation for Next Agent
Use **Option 1** (Limine Native Protocol) as it provides the most reliable path to working graphics output.
