## CHAPTER I: THE GREAT INLAND EXPEDITION

### When the Adventurers Packed Their Things 🎒

The SlopOS kernel was functional. Barely. But functional enough.

Fabrice, Leon, and Luis stood on the beaches of Sloptopia, gazing inland at the vast wilderness before them. The boot sequence had stabilized. The memory allocator held. The shell responded to commands. But something whispered to them from the jungle depths—*there was more*.

They gathered what few provisions remained from the shipwreck:
- **Scattered code fragments** clutched in weathered scrolls
- **Half-formed drivers** that promised miracles but delivered chaos
- **Uncommitted experiments** in kernel behavior modification
- **The infinite Essence of Leon**—his greatest treasure
- **Fabrice's wisdom**—precious and finite
- **Luis's hunger for expansion**—insatiable and dangerous

With nothing but determination and the faint hope that the wheel of fate would smile upon them, they ventured inland.

"We came this far," Leon said, his Essence glowing with resolve.

"We might as well see what breaks," Fabrice grinned.

And Luis simply nodded, already imagining what new subsystems could be grafted into the kernel's heart.

They took their first steps into Sloptopia's jungle.

The beach behind them faded into memory.

The unknown awaited ahead.

*And the wheel kept spinning...*
