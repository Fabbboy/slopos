# SlopOS Tasks Overview

This directory holds task briefs derived from the current SlopOS kernel review. Each `task-*.md` file targets a specific subsystem or bug and is written so an AI coding agent can pick it up as a self-contained assignment.

Each brief includes:
- Context summarizing the relevant code paths and current behaviour.
- Goals that define the expected outcomes or fixes.
- Detailed steps or checkpoints so the agent can act without re-reading the entire codebase.
- Validation guidance (commands, logs, or tests to run).

Update this README when adding new conventions or task templates.
