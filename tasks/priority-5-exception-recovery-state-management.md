# Priority 5 â€” Add Exception Recovery and State Management

## Summary
Implement robust exception recovery mechanisms and proper state management for the interrupt test framework to handle complex exception scenarios safely.

## Why This Matters
- Current exception handling lacks proper state restoration and recovery mechanisms.
- Complex exception scenarios (nested exceptions, state corruption) need robust recovery.
- Proper state management is essential for reliable exception testing and kernel stability.

## Scope & Deliverables
- Implement comprehensive CPU state saving and restoration for exception handlers.
- Add exception recovery mechanisms for handling nested exceptions and state corruption.
- Implement proper cleanup and state reset between test cases.
- Add exception context validation and corruption detection.
- Implement recovery from failed exception handling scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Exception handlers properly save and restore all CPU state without corruption.
- Nested exceptions are handled safely without causing system instability.
- Test framework can recover from failed exception handling scenarios.
- State validation detects and reports corruption in exception contexts.
- Full build and boot validation passes: `meson compile -C builddir`, `scripts/build_iso.sh`, and `scripts/run_qemu_ovmf.sh builddir/slop.iso 15` complete without errors.

## Notes for the Implementer
- Focus on comprehensive state management for all CPU registers and control structures.
- Test nested exception scenarios to verify recovery mechanisms.
- Ensure state validation doesn't interfere with normal exception handling.
